### Coming Soon

- **Phase 3**: Standalone desktop application with Docker isolation and local AI

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Add to Your Repository

Create `.github/workflows/powershell-security.yml`:

```yaml
name: PowerShell Security Analysis

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Run PowerShield Analysis
      shell: pwsh
      run: |
        Import-Module ./src/PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psm1 -Force
        $result = Invoke-WorkspaceAnalysis -WorkspacePath "."
        
        # Export results
        $result | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File 'powershield-results.json'
        
        # Generate SARIF
        . ./scripts/Convert-ToSARIF.ps1
        Convert-ToSARIF -InputFile 'powershield-results.json' -OutputFile 'powershield-results.sarif'
    
    - name: Upload SARIF
      uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
      with:
        sarif_file: powershield-results.sarif
```

### 2. Analyze Local Scripts

```powershell
# Import the analyzer
Import-Module ./src/PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psm1

# Analyze a single script
$result = Invoke-SecurityAnalysis -ScriptPath "./MyScript.ps1"

# View violations
$result.Violations | Format-Table RuleId, Severity, LineNumber, Message

# Analyze entire workspace
$workspaceResult = Invoke-WorkspaceAnalysis -WorkspacePath "."
Write-Host "Total violations: $($workspaceResult.TotalViolations)"

# Enable suppressions
$result = Invoke-SecurityAnalysis -ScriptPath "./MyScript.ps1" -EnableSuppressions
```

### 3. Use CLI Tools

PowerShield includes a comprehensive command-line interface (`psts`) for local development:

```bash
# Quick start - Interactive mode
./psts interactive

# Analyze files
./psts analyze ./scripts
./psts analyze --format sarif --output results.sarif

# Baseline management - Track new issues
./psts baseline create                              # Create baseline
./psts baseline create --description "Release 1.0"  # With description
./psts baseline compare                             # Compare with baseline
./psts baseline list                                # List all baselines
./psts baseline export --format html                # Export comparison report
./psts baseline share --team "DevOps"               # Share with team

# Compliance reporting - Enterprise governance
./psts compliance dashboard                         # Show all frameworks
./psts compliance assess --framework NIST           # Assess specific framework
./psts compliance gap-analysis --framework PCI-DSS  # Generate gap analysis
./psts compliance audit                             # Export audit evidence

# Fix management - Preview and apply security fixes
./psts fix preview
./psts fix apply --confidence 0.8

# Configuration
./psts config validate
./psts config init
./psts config show

# Install pre-commit hook
./psts install-hooks

# Show help
./psts help
```

**Alternative invocation (if `./psts` doesn't work):**

```bash
pwsh psts.ps1 <command> [options]
```

### 4. Enable Pre-Commit Hooks

Get immediate feedback before committing:

```bash
# Install the hook
./psts install-hooks

# Now commits are automatically checked
git add script.ps1
git commit -m "Add script"
# Hook runs automatically and blocks if violations found
```

Configure hook behavior in `.powershield.yml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  enabled: true
  block_on: ["Critical", "High"]  # Block commits with these severities
  auto_fix: false
```

See [Pre-Commit Hook Guide](docs/PRE_COMMIT_HOOK_GUIDE.md) for details.

## 🛠️ PowerShield CLI Reference

The PowerShield CLI provides comprehensive security analysis tools:

### Analysis Commands

```bash
# Analyze current directory
./psts analyze

# Analyze specific path
./psts analyze ./src

# Output formats
./psts analyze --format json --output results.json
./psts analyze --format sarif --output results.sarif
./psts analyze --format markdown --output report.md

# Compare with baseline
./psts analyze --baseline .powershield-baseline.json
```

### Baseline Management

Track new violations over time:

```bash
# Create baseline from current state
./psts baseline create

# Create baseline for specific path
./psts baseline create ./src

# Compare current state with baseline
./psts baseline compare

# Custom baseline file
./psts baseline create --output custom-baseline.json
./psts baseline compare --output custom-baseline.json
```

### Fix Management

Preview and apply security fixes:

```bash
# Preview available fixes
./psts fix preview

# Preview with higher confidence threshold
./psts fix preview --confidence 0.9

# Apply fixes (requires AI configuration)
./psts fix apply --confidence 0.8
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Validate current configuration
./psts config validate

# Show current configuration (JSON)
./psts config show

# Create default configuration file
./psts config init
```

### Interactive Mode

Run PowerShield with guided prompts:

```bash
# Start interactive mode
./psts interactive

# Or just run without arguments
./psts
```

Interactive mode provides a menu-driven interface for:

- Running security analysis
- Creating and managing baselines

## 📊 Enhanced SARIF Integration

PowerShield generates **SARIF 2.1.0** output with comprehensive security metadata that integrates with GitHub's Security tab and other security tools:

### Key Features

1. **Rich Metadata** - Every violation includes:
   - CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) IDs
   - MITRE ATT&CK technique mappings
   - OWASP Top 10 2021 categories
   - Help URLs with remediation guidance

2. **Automated Fix Suggestions** - Many rules provide multiple fix alternatives directly in SARIF
3. **Code Flow Tracking** - Complex vulnerabilities include data flow visualization
4. **GitHub Integration** - Results appear in Security → Code scanning tab with enhanced categorization

### Example Enhanced Rule

```json
{
  "id": "InsecureHashAlgorithms",
  "helpUri": "https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html",
  "properties": {
    "cwe": ["CWE-327", "CWE-328"],
    "mitreAttack": "T1553.002",
    "owasp": "A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures"
  }
}
```

### Benefits

- **Better Categorization** - Rules grouped by CWE and OWASP categories
- **Quick Fixes** - Suggested fixes appear directly in GitHub UI
- **Threat Context** - MITRE ATT&CK shows real-world attack scenarios
- **Compliance Ready** - Direct mappings for audit and compliance reports

See [Enhanced SARIF Output Documentation](./docs/Enhanced-SARIF-Output.md) for complete details.

## ⚙️ Configuration

PowerShield includes configurable options for customizing analysis behavior.

### Excluded Paths

By default, PowerShield excludes test scripts from workspace analysis to avoid flagging intentional violations used for testing:

```powershell
# Default exclusions
$analyzer.Configuration.ExcludedPaths = @(
    'tests/TestScripts',
    '*/TestScripts',
    'test/*',
    'tests/*'
)
```

Test scripts are still analyzed individually in the `test-analyzer` workflow job to verify the scanner is working correctly.

### Custom Configuration

```powershell
# Create analyzer with custom configuration
$analyzer = New-SecurityAnalyzer
$analyzer.Configuration.MaxFileSize = 20MB
$analyzer.Configuration.TimeoutSeconds = 60
$analyzer.Configuration.ExcludedPaths += 'vendor/*'
```

### Running Tests

```powershell
# Test the analyzer on sample vulnerable scripts
pwsh -Command "
    Import-Module ./src/PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psm1
    Get-ChildItem ./tests/TestScripts -Filter *.ps1 -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
        Write-Host \"Testing: $($_.FullName)\"
        $result = Invoke-SecurityAnalysis -ScriptPath $_.FullName
        Write-Host \"  Violations: $($result.Violations.Count)\"
    }
"
```

### Module Manifest

PowerShield includes a comprehensive module manifest (`PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psd1`) that provides:

- **Metadata**: Version, author, description, and licensing information
- **Dependencies**: PowerShell 7.0+ requirement and compatibility specification
- **Exports**: Explicit function exports for optimal performance
- **Tags**: Searchable keywords for module discovery
- **Release Notes**: Detailed version history and feature descriptions

```powershell
# Import using manifest (recommended)
Import-Module ./src/PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psd1

# Test manifest validity
Test-ModuleManifest ./src/PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer.psd1

# View module information
Get-Module PowerShellSecurityAnalyzer | Format-List
```

The manifest enables PowerShell's advanced module features including version checking, help integration, and gallery publishing.
