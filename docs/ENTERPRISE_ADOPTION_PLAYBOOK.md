```

### Week 3: Tuning & Feedback

**Activities**:
1. Review false positives
2. Add appropriate suppressions with justification
3. Tune severity thresholds
4. Customize rule configuration
5. Gather developer feedback

**Configuration Adjustments**:
```yaml
# .powershield.yml
analysis:
  severity_threshold: "High"  # Adjust based on team tolerance
  exclude_paths:
    - "vendor/**"
    - "legacy/**"  # Temporarily exclude legacy code

rules:
  # Disable noisy rules during pilot
  HardcodedURLs:
    enabled: false  # Too many false positives in pilot
```

### Week 4: Metrics & Assessment

**Data Collection**:
- Violations detected by severity
- False positive rate
- Time to resolution

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Too Many False Positives

**Symptoms**: Developers disable rules or ignore warnings

**Solutions**:
1. Tune severity thresholds
2. Add suppressions with justification
3. Customize rules for environment
4. Exclude legacy code temporarily

**Configuration**:
```yaml
rules:
  HardcodedURLs:
    severity: "Low"  # Reduce noise
  
analysis:
  exclude_paths:
    - "legacy/**"  # Exclude legacy temporarily
```

### Challenge 2: Resistance to Adoption

**Symptoms**: Low usage, complaints, workarounds

**Solutions**:
1. Communicate value proposition
2. Show quick wins and success stories
3. Provide adequate training and support
4. Address feedback promptly
5. Recognize early adopters

### Challenge 3: Build Time Impact

**Symptoms**: Slow CI/CD pipelines

**Solutions**:
1. Use incremental analysis mode
2. Optimize exclusion patterns
3. Run full analysis nightly, quick checks on PR
4. Use performance profiles

**Configuration**:
```yaml
analysis:
  parallel_analysis: true
  worker_threads: 4
  
ci:
  incremental_mode: true  # Only analyze changed files
```

### Challenge 4: Suppression Abuse

**Symptoms**: Excessive suppressions, expired suppressions not addressed

**Solutions**:
1. Require justification
2. Set short expiry (30 days)
3. Monthly suppression review
4. No permanent suppressions
5. Security team approval for critical rules

**Configuration**:
```yaml
suppressions:
  require_justification: true
  max_duration_days: 30
  allow_permanent: false
```
